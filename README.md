# Breaking-Builds
Real time full CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins.

## Overview

*Breaking-Builds* is a full CI/CD pipeline demo showcasing the journey of code from development to production, with each stage powered by Jenkins. The pipeline automates builds, tests, and deployments, ensuring that every line of code goes through the rigorous process of "cooking"—just like Heisenberg's meticulous lab work. This project demonstrates the power of automation in software delivery while having a fun Breaking Bad theme!

With this project, you can trigger builds, watch the stages unfold, and see firsthand how code is tested and deployed—without worrying about the DEA catching up with you.

## Features

- **Automated Builds**: The pipeline automatically builds code whenever a change is detected.
- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests are executed during the pipeline to ensure high-quality code.
- **Deployment**: Code is deployed automatically to production upon successful testing.
- **Real-time Updates**: Track the progress of each stage in the pipeline with live feedback.
- **Integration with GitHub**: GitHub integration ensures that every commit triggers the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Themed Workflow**: Inspired by Breaking Bad, the project includes fun references to the show and mimics Heisenberg's lab process in the CI/CD workflow.

## Tech Stack

- **Jenkins**: Orchestrates the entire CI/CD pipeline.
- **GitHub**: Hosts the code repository.
- **Python**: Used for backend code and tests.
- **Render**: Hosts the backend API.
- **Docker**: Used for containerized environments in Jenkins.
